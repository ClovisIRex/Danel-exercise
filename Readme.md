# Test1
____



You are in charge of the Test1 application.

You were given a 3rd party library (Test1.Core) that includes a Command Executor.

However, the command executor is unstable and throws exception from time to time. (You can see it by running the application multiple times).

## Requirements
Your mission is to enable retries.

You will need to make sure that the retries are enabled whenever someone uses the BusinessLogicManager. Do not assume that the current usage in Program.cs is the only one.

Be ready to __discuss__ what needs to be perfomed in order to make the application more robust and production-ready.

## Emphases
You are not allowed to change any code in the Test1.Core library. Source code is provided for your convenience.

Business logic is not to be harmed in any way.
